{"name":"Remote Messages App","tagline":"A Client for Remote Messages","body":"Hi,\r\nI've been using Remote Messages for a few months now and it’s become essential to me. Although, as time went by, I noted a few missing features that were inconvenient to me.\r\nSo I created a standalone app for Remote Messages (compatible with Windows only) for myself, but since I consider it to be an improvement, I thought: Why not share it?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n•\tAutomatic detection of the device’s IP address.\r\nIf you’re not always on the same Wi-Fi, you must always check and change your IP which can become laborious. The App does this for you: just save your device’s name and it finds your IP. \r\n•\tDrafts.\r\nSometimes, you’re writing a message but you receive another one that needs to be quickly answered: drafts are the solution. Just switch conversation, send your text, and go back: your previously began message has been saved and you can continue writing it.\r\n•\tReplaces text smileys by their EMOJI equivalent.\r\nSome of your contacts might not have an iPhone and send you text emoticons such as “:)”, “:(“. Just like in BiteSMS, these are replaced by their corresponding Emoji.\r\n•\tAutomatic Unfocus of a conversation.\r\nYou might have let your browser opened on your computer and then forgot it so that some messages got read and you never answered it. The App automatically unfocuses a conversation after a certain delay (determined by you) so that this does not happen anymore.\r\n•\tHalf-screen mode.\r\nNo address bar, no title bar, just your messages.\r\nFeatures to come: Notifications (with sound – volume, choice – preference and taskbar bleeping), embedded Image Viewer.\r\n\r\nIt’s not perfect but as I said it was originally for a personal use. However if some people are interested I can work on it, according to suggestions.\r\nAny (constructive) feedback is welcomed  !\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
