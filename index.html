<h3>What is Remote Messages?</h3>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatic detection of the device’s IP address.
<p>If you’re not always on the same Wi-Fi, you must always check and change your IP which can become laborious. The App does this for you: just save your device’s name and it finds your IP.</p></li>
<li>Drafts.
<p>Sometimes, you’re writing a message but you receive another one that needs to be quickly answered: drafts are the solution. Just switch conversation, send your text, and go back: your previously began message has been saved and you can continue writing it.</p></li>
<li>Replaces text smileys by their EMOJI equivalent.
<p>Some of your contacts might not have an iPhone and send you text emoticons such as “:)”, “:(“. Just like in BiteSMS, these are replaced by their corresponding Emoji.</p></li>
<li>Automatic Unfocus of a conversation.
<p>You might have let your browser opened on your computer and then forgot it so that some messages got read and you never answered it. The App automatically unfocuses a conversation after a certain delay (determined by you) so that this does not happen anymore.</p></li>
<li>Half-screen mode.
<p>No address bar, no title bar, just your messages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Features to come: Notifications (with sound – volume, choice – preference and taskbar bleeping), embedded Image Viewer.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
