<h2>What is Remote Client?</h2>
<p>Remote Client is a standalone application bringing some more features to the already awesome <a href="http://www.remotemessages.com/">Remote Messages</a>.
This is a personal project shared here for those interested. If you have any constructive comment, suggestion, request, please check this <a href="http://www.remotemessages.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/157/windows-client-for-remote-messages#Item_1">link</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Automatic detection of the device’s IP address.</h3>
<p>If you’re not always on the same Wi-Fi, you must always check and change your IP which can become laborious. The App does this for you: just save your device’s name and it finds your IP.</p></li>
<li><h3>Drafts.</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you’re writing a message but you receive another one that needs to be quickly answered: drafts are the solution. Just switch conversation, send your text, and go back: your previously began message has been saved and you can continue writing it.</p></li>
<li><h3>Replaces text smileys by their EMOJI equivalent.</h3>
<p>Some of your contacts might not have an iPhone and send you text emoticons such as “:)”, “:(“. Just like in BiteSMS, these are replaced by their corresponding Emoji.</p></li>
<li><h3>Automatic Unfocus of a conversation.</h3>
<p>You might have let your browser opened on your computer and then forgot it so that some messages got read and you never answered it. The App automatically unfocuses a conversation after a certain delay (determined by you) so that this does not happen anymore.</p></li>
<li><h3>Half-screen mode.</h3>
<p>No address bar, no title bar, just your messages.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Press F1 to display options and help.</p>
