        <p>Hi,
I've been using Remote Messages for a few months now and it’s become essential to me. Although, as time went by, I noted a few missing features that were inconvenient to me.
So I created a standalone app for Remote Messages (compatible with Windows only) for myself, but since I consider it to be an improvement, I thought: Why not share it?</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatic detection of the device’s IP address.
<p>If you’re not always on the same Wi-Fi, you must always check and change your IP which can become laborious. The App does this for you: just save your device’s name and it finds your IP.</p></li>
• Drafts.
Sometimes, you’re writing a message but you receive another one that needs to be quickly answered: drafts are the solution. Just switch conversation, send your text, and go back: your previously began message has been saved and you can continue writing it.
• Replaces text smileys by their EMOJI equivalent.
Some of your contacts might not have an iPhone and send you text emoticons such as “:)”, “:(“. Just like in BiteSMS, these are replaced by their corresponding Emoji.
• Automatic Unfocus of a conversation.
You might have let your browser opened on your computer and then forgot it so that some messages got read and you never answered it. The App automatically unfocuses a conversation after a certain delay (determined by you) so that this does not happen anymore.
• Half-screen mode.
No address bar, no title bar, just your messages.
</ul>
Features to come: Notifications (with sound – volume, choice – preference and taskbar bleeping), embedded Image Viewer.</p>

<p>It’s not perfect but as I said it was originally for a personal use. However if some people are interested I can work on it, according to suggestions.
Any (constructive) feedback is welcomed  !
Thanks for reading.</p>
